				<a href="images/HallPic.png" data-lightbox="image" data-title = "Hallway" class="mix art"><img src = "images/HallPic.png" alt = "The hallway of my old school"/></a>
				<h3>The Hallway</h3>
				<p>I was very interested in architecture at the time I made this.  This is a hallway in my highschool and I made it using shaprie.  Using different desgins, such as dots and lines, I was able to add texture and depth to create a sense of what features the hallway had.</p>

				<a href ="images/HockeyPic.png" data-lightbox="image" data-title="An portrait I did with pointalism" class="mix-art"><img src = "images/HockeyPic.png" alt = "A pointalism piece of me from hockey"/></a>
				<h3>Hockey Drawing</h3>
				<p>A huge part of my life was given to hockey.  From moving away from home at an early age, to the early mornings to train.  Using pointalism, I wanted to capture a portrait of myself in my comfort zone, in my uniform.</p>

			<div class="itemi">
				<a href ="images/hat.png" data-lightbox="image" data-title="One of my first sketches, a hat in any empty room." class="mix-art"><img src = "images/hat.png" alt = "My Hat on a box in a room"/></a>
				<h3>My Hat</h3>
				<p>This was one of the first pieces I had ever done.  For a simple class project, we had to sketch an item and the area surrounding it using techniques we learned in class.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="itemi">
				<a href ="images/DoorwayPic.png" data-lightbox="image" data-title="An abstract piece of a door in confusing landscape." class="mix-art"><img src = "images/DoorwayPic.png" alt = "A doorway drawn abstractly with sharpie"/></a>
				<h3>The Hidden Doorway</h3>
				<p>This is one of my favorite pieces because I made it with no goal in mind.  I was simply bored one day and began drawing lines using a ruler.  Eventually, I saw door take shape and began to shade in between some of the lines I drew.</p>
